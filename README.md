# Pantry Tracker
Home pantry tracking with notifications in advance to prevent food from spoiling

### Planned features
* Scanning product Barcodes
* Customizing portions per product
* Reminders to eat food before it spoils
* Per portion reminders for foods with multiple portions
* Manage multiple pantries in one app
* Backup/restore pantries across installations

The following features are currently unplanned but are in my mind for a later time.

* Automatic synchronization of pantries across installations
* Automatic order online (may have to manually do checkout, but maybe like automatically put all the stuff into your cart)

### Roadmap/TODO
* Create datastructures (using protobuf, to keep serialization optimal)
* Create SQLITE DB wrappers
* Create Barcode API library (powered by: [BarcodeLookup.com](https://www.barcodelookup.com/api))
* Get simple pantry actions to work (create, add product, delete product, delete)
* Get notifications to work
* Get backup/restore to work
* Automatic checking for updates
